# H-Task


This is my first own Laravel project. I'm using it to improve my knowledge and for creating invoices.


To do list:

<ul>
  <li>Create customer section</li>
  <li>Create connection between invoice form and lists of customers with autocomplete</li>
  <li>Create dashboard for invoices and tasks</li>
  <li>Create editable user profiles with information for invoicing</li>
  <li>Sending of created invoice to an e-mail</li>
  <li>Rewrite models from old-school way and use Laravel migrations</li>
  <li>clear the code</li>
  <li>Improve solutions and make it more Laravel</li>
</ul>
